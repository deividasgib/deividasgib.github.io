					<p>I started playing football at a very young age, in my hometown Silute, which is a city not too far from where I study in Klaipeda. I played for different age groups there essentially being promoted to men's first team when I entered 1th grade in high school. I found some life long friends there and it shaped me as a person that I am today.</p>
					<p>After graduating from high school, I understood that it will be difficult to get a good quality of life from football there, so I decided to apply for LCC International University. During my first weeks there, I learned that they also have a football team here. So, I definitely wanted to be a part of the team. I went to trials, workouts with the team and eventually got accepted to a team.</p>
					<p>So, I was part of LCC Moose for four years, and learned so much from this experience. I improved my skills, strength as well as game knowledge. These goals that I scored in front of LCC community was really special, and will remember it for a long future. I feel blessed to have my number 10 retired and feel grateful for everyone involved there.<p>
					<p>If you would like to work on your game with me, or apply to LCC Moose men's team, deifnitely go ahead and contact me here.<p>
