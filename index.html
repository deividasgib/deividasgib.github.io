						<p>Hello, my name is Deividas Gibėža and I'm a fourth year student at LCC International University. I'm 23 years old, but already with some interesting experiences in life that I'm willing to share with you. Having worked at few, but entirely different companies allowed me to gain knowledge in different fields and get a good grasp of what to expect in the future. At the moment, the most interesting area for me is digital marketing, so expect to have a few new blog posts in the blog section in the near future.</p>
