						<p>LCC International University is a great place to learn more about the world. It has many international students that decide to participate in Work & Travel program. This is why me and my friend also chose to participate in such adventure. It was a great way to get job experience and overall learn about new country which is so big and powerful. So, we found a job in Maine, Portland. We worked at an amusement park and met some great people there. By the way, we still stay in touch with these people after more than two years since being there.</p> 
						<p>Although we worked hard and wanted to earn some good money, we also managed to find more than enough time to travel a little bit. Biggest trips that we had was to Boston and essentially and the end of the summer to New York. That trip was the highlight of the whole summer.</p>
						<p>Participating in this program was really beneficial for me. Experience was unforgettable and really useful. So, if you would like to know about the details how to get ready for this program and essentially end up in United States, don't hesitate to <a href="Contact.html">contact me here.</a></p>
