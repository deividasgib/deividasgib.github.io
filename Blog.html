	  <h3>Make Sure to Get the Best Out of Storytelling<h3>
	<h5><p class="text-left">Great storytelling can bring huge benefits to your promotion because it brings lots of human emotions, motivations and involves psychology which is a pretty powerful tool.</p></h5>
	<h5><p class="text-left">In order for storytelling to be successful, it has to be unique and distinguishable from others. This will create a bond between the viewer and the teller to make it more difficult to forget. Sometimes being unique can be difficult, but it is important to be sincere and really show your feelings.</p></h5>
	<h5><p class="text-left">Before using storytelling, it is important to have a good plan and a good structure of the story. This will make it easier to understand for the customer and engage more with the story.</p></h5>
	<h5><p class="text-left">The importance of the main character of the story is just as significant as anything. Make it interesting. For example, people always love when underdogs perform well and succeed. Especially if they are against something bigger. This creates a nice story and often times people remember that.</p></h5>
	<h5><p class="text-left">Do not forget about the emotions. It easier to understand about emotions when you think about yourself a lot more. What makes you feel what you think? Remember that and use it for your advantage when thinking about other people. What makes them behave like they behave? Do not forget to question yourself and learn to tell more authentic stories and reach more people with your feelings.</p></h5>
	<h5><p class="text-left">Being unique and distinguish from others is always difficult. This is why it is important to challenge yourself and think bigger and deeper. Do not use the first thing that comes to your mind. Or even the second or the third. Think deeply to really reach people to make it interesting for them.</p></h5>
	<h5><p class="text-left">And the last thing, sometimes best stories are simple and easy to understand!</p></h5>
